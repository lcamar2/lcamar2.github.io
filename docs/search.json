    "text": "As an activist researcher deeply embedded within the confluence of education, public health, economics, and housing, particularly in the context of urban immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities, my work is profoundly shaped by my personal and cultural background. Born and raised on the southwest side of Chicago within a predominantly Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrant enclave, my identity is rooted in a bicultural and bilingual (Mexican-American) experience. This duality of culture, along with being raised in a dual-working household affected by economic downturns and having served as a translator for my family, has offered me unique insights into the challenges faced by similar communities.\nMy academic journey as a non-traditional, first-generation college and graduate school student was motivated by a desire to understand and address the economic effects of the 2008 recession and the 2016 State of Illinois budget stalemate. These events not only influenced my economic stability but also highlighted the broader societal neglect of policies impacting citizenry status, social, cultural, human, and economic capital on social and wealth mobility.\nThe theoretical underpinnings of my research, views and interests are informed by a diverse array of scholars. The economic and societal critiques of Karl Polanyi, Richard Wolff, Ha-Joon Chang, and Thomas Picketty, alongside the philosophical insights of Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Franz Fanon, among others, have shaped my critical approach to examining unchallenged and widely accepted ideas. My work is driven by a commitment to interrogate the systemic structures that govern urban immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities, guided by a heterodox economic perspective and a philosophical inclination towards questioning the status quo.\nAcknowledging my positionality involves recognizing the biases and assumptions I bring to my work and analysis. As someone who has lived the experiences of my research interests, there is an inherent risk of over-identification or imposing my interpretations on the data. However, this lived experience also provides me with an intimate understanding of the nuances and complexities of certain communities, enabling a more empathetic and insightful approach to my analysis and work. To mitigate potential biases, I commit to rigorous reflexivity, constantly questioning how my background influences my interpretation and ensuring that my findings are grounded in the data rather than my preconceptions.\nEthically, my activism is conducted with a keen awareness of the power dynamics at play, particularly in engaging with communities that share my heritage but may not share my academic or economic opportunities. My aim is to ensure that my work not only contributes to political discourse but also serves the interests and needs of the communities at the heart of my activism/research, promoting social and economic equity.\nIn conclusion, my positionality as a bicultural, bilingual, first-generation academic with roots in Chicagoâ€™s Mexican immigrant community is both a lens through which I view my activism/research and a bridge connecting me to people. It is through this lens that I navigate the complex interplay of education, public health, economics, and civic power, striving to contribute to a more just and equitable understanding and treatment of people."
